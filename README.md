## 🚧 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x (for local development) (v20.11.0 used while building)
- PNPM package manager
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Google Maps API key and Map ID

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="your_google_maps_api_key_here"
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_ID="your_map_id_here"
```

### Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Docker Deployment

Build and run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 💪 Challenges & Solutions

The main challenge was integrating the Maps JavaScript API for 3D into a Next.js framework. While the vis.gl library was initially considered for its React-friendly approach, the ongoing development of the Maps JavaScript API for 3D limited vis.gl's functionality. This demanded careful planning of component structure and architecture in Next.js to ensure smooth operation and seamless automatic animation capabilities within the 3D visualization.

## 🏆 Achievements

As a solo developer project, notable achievements include:

- Successful integration of multiple Google APIs
- Production-ready application delivering real user value
- Creation of an immersive travel planning experience

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

Exciting features planned for future releases:

### Short-term Goals

- Immersive marketing features (3D advertisements)
- Weather visualization along routes

### Long-term Vision

- Virtual tourism sector expansion
- Crowd-sourced location insights
