## üöß Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x (for local development) (v20.11.0 used while building)
- PNPM package manager
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Google Maps API key and Map ID

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="your_google_maps_api_key_here"
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_ID="your_map_id_here"
```

### Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Docker Deployment

Build and run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üí™ Challenges & Solutions

The main challenge was integrating 3D visualization capabilities. While vis.gl library was considered for its React-friendly approach, the Maps JavaScript API for 3D was still in development, which affected vis.gl's functionality. This required careful planning of component structure and architecture to ensure smooth operation.

## üèÜ Achievements

As a solo developer project, notable achievements include:

- Successful integration of multiple Google APIs
- Production-ready application delivering real user value
- Creation of an immersive travel planning experience

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

Exciting features planned for future releases:

### Short-term Goals

- Immersive marketing features (3D advertisements)
- Weather visualization along routes
- Performance optimization for complex 3D scenes

### Long-term Vision

- Virtual tourism sector expansion
- Crowd-sourced location insights
